# Image Super Resolution Project

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the Statistical Machine Learning course, where the goal was to implement and compare three state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Image Super Resolution. The models implemented include SRGAN, ESRGAN, and SRFeat.

## Project Scope
The primary objective of this project was to explore and analyze the effectiveness of different GAN architectures in enhancing the resolution of images. Each model was carefully implemented and fine-tuned to understand their respective strengths and limitations.

## Implemented GANs
### 1. SRGAN (Super-Resolution GAN):
SRGAN is known for its ability to generate high-resolution images by learning from a dataset of low-resolution images.

### 2. ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN):
ESRGAN is an enhanced version of SRGAN, incorporating advanced features to produce even more visually appealing results.

### 3. SRFeat (Super-Resolution Feature-based GAN):
SRFeat focuses on leveraging feature information for superior image super-resolution results.

## Comparative Analysis
The project includes a comprehensive comparative analysis of the three GAN models, considering factors such as image quality, computational efficiency, and training stability. Results and findings are presented in the accompanying report.
